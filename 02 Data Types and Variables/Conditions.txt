Town Info
You will be given 3 lines of input. On the first line you will be given the name of the town, on the second – the population and on the third the area. Use the correct data types and print the result in the following format:
"Town {town name} has population of {population} and area {area} square km".

Convert Meters to Kilometres

Lower or Upper
Write a program that prints whether a given character is upper-case or lower case.

Snowballs
Tony and Andi love playing in the snow and having snowball fights, but they always argue which makes the best snowballs. Because they are girls (which means they are completely illogical), they have decided to involve you in their fray, by making you write a program which calculates snowball data, and outputs the best snowball value.
You will receive N – an integer, the number of snowballs being made by Tony and Andi.
For each snowball you will receive 3 input lines:
•	On the first line you will get the snowballSnow – an integer.
•	On the second line you will get the snowballTime – an integer.
•	On the third line you will get the snowballQuality – an integer.
For each snowball you must calculate its snowballValue by the following formula:
(snowballSnow / snowballTime) ^ snowballQuality
At the end you must print the highest calculated snowballValue.
Input
•	On the first input line you will receive N – the number of snowballs.
•	On the next N * 3 input lines you will be receiving data about snowballs. 
Output
•	As output you must print the highest calculated snowballValue, by the formula, specified above. 
•	The output format is: 
{snowballSnow} : {snowballTime} = {snowballValue} ({snowballQuality})
Constraints
•	The number of snowballs (N) will be an integer in range [0, 100].
•	The snowballSnow is an integer in range [0, 1000].
•	The snowballTime is an integer in range [1, 500].
•	The snowballQuality is an integer in range [0, 100].
•	Allowed working time / memory: 100ms / 16MB.

Poke Mon
A Poke Mon is a special type of pokemon which likes to Poke others. But at the end of the day, the Poke Mon wants to keeps statistics, about how many pokes it has managed to make.
The Poke Mon pokes his target, and then proceeds to poke another target. The distance between his targets reduces his poke power.
You will be given the poke power the Poke Mon has, N – an integer.
Then you will be given the distance between the poke targets, M – an integer.
Then you will be given the exhaustionFactor Y – an integer.
Your task is to start subtracting M from N until N becomes less than M, i.e. the Poke Mon does not have enough power to reach the next target. 
Every time you subtract M from N that means you’ve reached a target and poked it successfully. COUNT how many targets you’ve poked – you’ll need that count.
The Poke Mon becomes gradually more exhausted. IF N becomes equal to EXACTLY 50 % of its original value, you must divide N by Y, if it is POSSIBLE. This DIVISION is between integers.
If a division is not possible, you should NOT do it. Instead, you should continue subtracting.
After dividing, you should continue subtracting from N, until it becomes less than M.
When N becomes less than M, you must take what has remained of N and the count of targets you’ve poked, and print them as output.
NOTE: When you are calculating percentages, you should be PRECISE at maximum.
Example: 505 is NOT EXACTLY 50 % from 1000, its 50.5 %.
Input
•	The input consists of 3 lines.
•	On the first line you will receive N – an integer.
•	On the second line you will receive M – an integer.
•	On the third line you will receive Y – an integer.
Output
•	The output consists of 2 lines.
•	On the first line print what has remained of N, after subtracting from it.
•	On the second line print the count of targets, you’ve managed to poke.
Constrains
•	The integer N will be in the range [1, 2.000.000.000].
•	The integer M will be in the range [1, 1.000.000].
•	The integer Y will be in the range [0, 9].
•	Allowed time / memory: 16 MB / 100ms.

From Left to The Right
You will receive number which represent how many lines we will get as an input. On the next N lines, you will receive a string with 2 numbers separated by single space. You need to compare them. If the left number is greater than the right number, you need to print the sum of all digits in the left number, otherwise print the sum of all digits in the right number.

Exchange Integers
Read two integer numbers and after that exchange their values by using some programming logic. Print the variable
values before and after the exchange.

Floating Equality
Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers with precision eps = 0.000001. Note that we cannot directly compare two floating-point numbers a and b by a==b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely to each other than some fixed constant eps. You will receive two lines, each containing a floating-point number. Your task is to compare the values of the two numbers.

Data Type Finder
You will receive an input until you receive "END". Find what data type is the input. Possible data types are:
-Integer
-Floating point
-Characters
-Boolean
-Strings
Print the result in the following format: "{input} is {data type} type"
